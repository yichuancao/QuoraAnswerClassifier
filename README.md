QuoraAnswerClassifier
=====================

This is my implementation and experiment (in progress) with Quora's machine learning challenge question
. http://www.quora.com/challenges#answer_classifier
I have already tried k-NN algorithm and it is about 70% to 75% accuracy, depending on how I choose K and whether I reduce the dimension of the data. However, it is quite slow without sklearn library. The current stage is to try using perceptron and further speed up data preprocessing.
